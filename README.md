This is just a demo version to carry out below tasks:
1. Text extraction from multiple pdfs
2. Taking question as input
3. Giving an appropriate output for question by considering all source pdfs

Problems faced: Slow processing speed for large pdfs and requirement of good machine specification for running locally

Demo version to try out model if dont want to run locally: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ayush28/demo-app (Still issue of slow processing)
